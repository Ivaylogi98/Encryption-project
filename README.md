# Encryption-project
Encrypting and decrypting a text with assembly. Project for the university course Computer Architectures Practicum
# Getting started
1. Install DOSBox
2. Copy `proj.asm` to `tasm/BIN`
3. Start DosBox
4. run `mount <name> <absolute_path>`
5. run `[name]:`
6. run `tasm <file_name>`
7. run `link <file_name>`
8. run program with `<file_name>`
# Usage
After starting the program press `1` to encrypt or `2` to decrypt. Three different ecnryption algorithms are used to create three encryption levels, meaning that you can encrypt 3 times. Input should be written in `input.txt`. Output is in `output.txt`.
